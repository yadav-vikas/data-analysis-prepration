eating, Loading, and Selecting Data with Pandas


Pandas is a Python module for working with tabular data (i.e., data in a table with rows and columns). Tabular data has a lot of the same functionality as SQL or Excel, but Pandas adds the power of Python.

In order to get access to the Pandas module, we’ll need to install the module and then import it into a Python file. To learn how to install Python modules for data analysis on your personal computer, please refer to the following Codecademy resource:

```
   pip install pandas
```
Importing the Pandas Module
The pandas module is usually imported at the top of a Python file under the alias pd:

```
import pandas as pd
```
If we need to access the pandas module, we can do so by operating on pd.

In this lesson, you’ll learn the basics of working with a single table in Pandas, such as.


Create a table from scratch
Loading data from another file
Selecting certain rows or columns of a table
data manipulation and with rows and columns
renaming and replacing data
